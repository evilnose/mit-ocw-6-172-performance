The issue is that for size 512, when I am writing to each column of
the output matrix, they all map to the same cache set. Need to pretend
that the row length is something not a multiple of 2 so that they map to
different sets as in 511/513.

For larger matrix sizes like 2048, the cache is full after 2 rows are
rotated and so there will be capacity misses and the effect of conflict
misses become diminished, i.e. when writing to the next column of the 
output matrix the previous column has already been evicted from the cache
due to over-filling.
